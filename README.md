# Backup System

## About

This is a simple backup system made in bash where the user can create new .tar backups of various directories and manage the backups.

## Instalation

To install it you first need to git clone this repo via https or ssh, then add the backup-system directory to your `$PATH`, this will be important to make the script executable anywhere in the operating sistem.

Then give the correct execution permissions to the script (I recommend 744).
